Physical Zone
=============

Create Physical Zone
--------------------

1. Entering data manually using a form

  Choose this option if you want to create a **Physical Zone** using a
  form.

  **Physical Zone** allows you to manage the physically homogeneous zones defined
  for the valuation and which delimit the zones that have similar physical characteristics.

2. From another QGIS layer/table (setting a field mapping)

  Choose this option to open a window that allows you to import data from a source
  table into the *LADM_COL* **zona_homogenea_fisica** table.

  If the field structure of input and target tables differs, you can set a field
  mapping to define field transformations and correspondence.

  For use this function check this `LINK <../mapping_fields.html>`_.
