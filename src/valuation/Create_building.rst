2. From another QGIS layer/table (setting a field mapping)

Choose this option to open a window that allows you to import data from a
source table into the *LADM_COL* **avaluos_v2_2_1avaluos_construccion** table.

If the field structure of input and target tables differs, you can set a field
mapping to define field transformations and correspondence.
