2. From another QGIS layer/table (setting a field mapping)

  Choose this option to open a window that allows you to import data from a source
  table into the *LADM_COL* **equipamiento_comunal** table.

  If the field structure of input and target tables differs, you can set a field
  mapping to define field transformations and correspondence.
