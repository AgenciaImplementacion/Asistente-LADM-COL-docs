Administrative Source
----------------------

1. Entering data manually using a form

Choose this option if you want to create an **Administrative Source** using a
form.

**Administrative Source** is a specialization of the *COL_Fuente* class to store
those sources corresponding to documents (mortgage document, notarial documents,
historical documents, and the like) that document the relationship
between parties and parcels.

2. From another QGIS layer/table (setting a field mapping)

Choose this option to open a window that allows you to import data from a source
table into the *LADM_COL* **col_fuenteadministrativa** table.

If the field structure of input and target tables differs, you can set a field
mapping to define field transformations and correspondence.

Spatial Source
---------------

1. Entering data manually using a form

Choose this option if you want to create a **Spatial Source** using a form.

**Spatial Source** is a specialization of the *COL_Fuente* class to store those
sources corresponding to spatial data (geographic features, satellite imagery,
photogrammetric flights, maps, coordinate listings, ancient or modern plans,
location descriptions, and the like) that technically document the relationship
between parties and parcels.

2. From another QGIS layer/table (setting a field mapping)

Choose this option to open a window that allows you to import data from a source
table into the *LADM_COL* **col_fuenteespacial** table.

If the field structure of input and target tables differs, you can set a field
mapping to define field transformations and correspondence.
