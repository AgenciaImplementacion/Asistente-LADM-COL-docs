Toolbar LADM_COL
*****************

This is how toolbar looks like:

   :alt: LADM-COL toolbar

If the toolbar does not appear on the QGIS interface, you can make it show with
the next interaction: right click on the gray region in QGIS and clicking in
"LADM-COL Toolbar" or like in the following gif:

Explode and Merge
=================

If you need to merge or explodes boundaries you can use the *merge* and *explode*
buttons on Toolbar LADM_COL.

Fill Points BFS
================

You can fill point bfs topology table using the button *Fill Point BFS* on
Toolbar LADM_COL which makes automatic and faster this job.

This are the tables that relate with this function:

- puntosccl --> puntolindero and lindero

Fill More BFS and Less
=======================

You can fill More BFS and Less topology table using the button *Fill More BFS
and Less* on Toolbar LADM_COL which makes automatic and faster this job.

This are the tables that relate with this function:

- masccl --> terreno and lindero
- menos --> terreno and lindero (holes or intern rings)

Fill Right Of Way relations
===========================

You have to select one **Right of Way**, one or more **Plot(s)** which will be benefited
with the Right of Way, and one or more **Administrative Source(s)** which support
this Right of Way. The plugin automatically creates the relations between benefited
parcels and the restrictions. Is important to know that you should have relations
between parcels and plots to avoid any issue with this function

Generate Annex 17
=================

This option allows generating a document associated with the selected plots,
which corresponds to Annex 17, this contain a report of adjoining.

The adjoining report corresponds to the document where they will be identified
by property (with formal or informal tenure relations) each of the boundaries
that constitute it and its corresponding physical and legal relationship with
the properties surrounding it.

To generate the report of annex 17, follow these steps:

1. Select the plot (s) for which you want to generate the report.

2. Go to the toolbar and click on the button "Generate Annex 17"

Download dependencies. This step is done only once.

3. You must indicate the directory where you want to store the generated documents.

4. Press ok should show a progress bar at the top.

5. You will obtain the validation of the generated reports with a message bar in green and inside it a link to the route where the files are located.
6. Go to the directory that you selected in step 3 to verify the result, which should look like this in the following image:

Import from intermediate structure
==================================

This section exposes the procedure to be followed in order to be able to massively import data from spreadsheet format files to a database with the structure of the LADM_COL model.

Previous requirements:

1. Data coinciding with the intermediate structure, as shown in the images:

+ Structure of Grouping:

   :height: 60
   :width: 380
   :alt: basic settings

+ Structure of Law:

   :alt: basic settings

+ Structure of Party:

+ Structure of Plot:

`Blank template of intermediate structure. <static/data_templates/estructura_vacia.xlsx>`_

`Example data according to the intermediate structure. <static/data_templates/estructura.xlsx>`_


The procedure is the next:

1. In the toolbar click on the button that says: "Import from intermediate structure"
2. In the toolbar click on the button that says: Select the file with spreadsheet format where the information to be loaded is stored.
3. Accept the dialogue and wait for the result.
4. Confirm that in QGIS the intermediate tables were created and that the model tables involved were left with new data.

The execution of the model with the sample data should generate the following result:

Intermediate tables:
