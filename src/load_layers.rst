Load Layers
***********

The LADM-COL Assistant has a tool to load layers, preserving the characteristics
of the .ili model with which the database was generated.

This allows to load one or many layers automatically configuring the domains,
dependencies and relationships of the model, as well as a unique symbology for
each spatial layer that is loaded. It also has some layers to load by default.
