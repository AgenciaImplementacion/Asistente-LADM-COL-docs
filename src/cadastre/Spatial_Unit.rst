Spatial Unit
=============

In this process you define the new spatial objects that you want to add to the
database with the structure of the *LADM_COL* model.


Create Plot
-----------

1. Selecting existing boundaries

Choose this option if you want to create a **Plot** from existing *Boundaries*.

**Plot** is a portion of land with a defined geographical extension.

2. From another QGIS Layer/table (setting a field mapping)

Choose this option to open a window that allows you to import data from a source
layer into the *LADM_COL* **terreno** layer.

If the field structure of input and target layers differs, you can set a field
mapping to define field transformations and correspondence.
