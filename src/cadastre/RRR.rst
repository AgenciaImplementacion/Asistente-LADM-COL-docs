Right
-----

1. Entering data manually using a form
(you need to select Administrative sources before)

Choose this option if you have selected at least one *Administrative Source* and
want to link such selected sources to a new **Right** that you will create using
a form.

**COL_Right** is a class that stores right instances that a party has over a
parcel. It is a specialization of the class *LA_RRR*.

2. From another QGIS layer/table (setting a field mapping)

Choose this option to open a window that allows you to import data from a source
table into the *LADM_COL* **col_derecho table**.

If the field structure of input and target tables differs, you can set a field
mapping to define field transformations and correspondence.

Restriction

1. Entering data manually using a form
(you need to select Administrative sources before)

Choose this option if you have selected at least one *Administrative Source* and
want to link such selected sources to a new **Restriction** that you will create

**COL_Restriction** are the restrictions on a parcel that affect rights that parties
may have over it.

2. From another QGIS layer/table (setting a field mapping)

Choose this option to open a window that allows you to import data from a source
table into the *LADM_COL* **col_restriccion table**.

If the field structure of input and target tables differs, you can set a field
mapping to define field transformations and correspondence.

Responsibility
--------------

1. Entering data manually using a form
(you need to select Administrative sources before)

Choose this option if you have selected at least one *Administrative Source* and
want to link such selected sources to a new **Responsibility** that you will create
using a form.

**COL_Responsibility** is a class of type *LA_RRR* which stores responsibilities
that parties have over parcels.

2. From another QGIS layer/table (setting a field mapping)

Choose this option to open a window that allows you to import data from a source
table into the *LADM_COL* **col_responsabilidad** table.

If the field structure of input and target tables differs, you can set a field
mapping to define field transformations and correspondence.
