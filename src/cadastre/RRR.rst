1. Entering data manually using a form (you need to select Administrative sources before)

  Choose this option if you have selected at least one *Administrative Source* and
  want to link such selected sources to a new **Right** that you will create using
  a form.

  **COL_Right** is a class that stores right instances that a party has over a
  parcel. It is a specialization of the class *LA_RRR*.

2. From another QGIS layer/table (setting a field mapping)

  Choose this option to open a window that allows you to import data from a source
  table into the *LADM_COL* **col_derecho table**.

  If the field structure of input and target tables differs, you can set a field
  mapping to define field transformations and correspondence.

  For use this function check this `LINK <../mapping_fields.html>`_.
